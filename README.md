# CarDekho EDA & Regression Analysis

![CarDekho Logo](cardekho_logo.png)

Welcome to the **CarDekho EDA & Regression Analysis** repository! In this project, we dive into the CarDekho Cars dataset using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques and build regression models to predict car prices.

## About the Dataset

The dataset contains essential information about various cars, including features that could influence the selling price. Here are some key columns in the dataset:

- **Name**: This represents the name or model of the car. While not a direct determinant of the selling price, different car models can have varying reputations, features, and desirability, which could impact the price.
- **Year**: The manufacturing year of the car. Newer cars often command higher prices due to features, design, and overall condition.
- **Selling Price**: The actual price at which the seller intends to sell the car. This is the target value that's influenced by other columns.
- **Kilometers Driven (km_driven)**: The car's mileage in kilometers. Lower mileage cars generally fetch higher selling prices.
- **Fuel Type (fuel)**: The type of fuel the car uses. Fuel efficiency, costs, and environmental concerns can influence the price.
- **Seller Type**: Indicates who is selling the car, whether an individual, dealership, or another entity.
- **Transmission**: The car's transmission type. Automatic transmissions could impact prices due to convenience.
- **Owner**: The number of previous owners the car has had. Fewer owners are typically more desirable and might lead to higher prices.
